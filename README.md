Validation of Neuroon startup
-----------------------------
One of most successful Polish startup companies, Neuroon, made a claim they can automatically classify sleep stages and increase sleep quality using a small wearable mask.


We compared the sleep stage classification produced by Neuroon with a clinical standard polysomnography recording.One of most successful Polish startup companies, Neuroon, made a claim they can automatically classify sleep stages and increase sleep quality using a small wearable mask.

We have divided the Neuroon validation into three stages:

1. First we assessed whether the EEG signal collected with Neuroon is similar at any point in time to the polysomnography EEG signal. 
2. Second we assessed accuracy with which Neuroon predicted the sleep stage. 
3. Third we assessed whether there is enough information in the EEG signal to discriminate on that basis between the sleep stages.
